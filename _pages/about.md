Felicitations! My name is Jared Brannan. I am a combinatorialist in training, singer, musician, and lover of code and data.
I am currently working on my PhD in mathematics at Washington State University under Dr. Matthew Hudelson.

Here I (rarely) share mathematical musings, updates on publications, and whatever other nonsense I find interesting. 
This website can also serve as a sort of digital CV.
